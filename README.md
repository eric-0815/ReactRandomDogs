# Assignment

Create a React app to display random dogs from the following API:

https://random.dog/woof.json

* The app should present 8 results on the screen.

* The app should be responsive:

  * For desktop there should be 4 results to a row.

  * For mobile there should be 1 result per row.

* There should be a button to allow the user to fetch a new set of 8 random dogs.

* The app should support common formats such as jpg, gif, png and mp4 results (if you encounter any totally random file types like psd just ignore that result and fetch another in its place)

* Use git for version control.

* Push your finished solution and full commit history to a public repo on Github and send the link back

* Include a brief Readme with instructions how to run the application and any other extra info or assumptions made that you would like to call out

# Bonus Points

* Include some unit tests, but don't worry about 100% test coverage.

# Hint

We suggest you leverage [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) to get started.
